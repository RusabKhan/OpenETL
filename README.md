and **update them** according to your environment:

```bash
OPENETL_DOCUMENT_HOST=localhost
OPENETL_DOCUMENT_DB=airflow
OPENETL_DOCUMENT_SCHEMA=open_etl
OPENETL_DOCUMENT_USER=MY_USER
OPENETL_DOCUMENT_PASS=1234
OPENETL_DOCUMENT_PORT=5432
OPENETL_DOCUMENT_ENGINE=PostgreSQL
OPENETL_HOME="/Users/usr/OpenETL"
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
```

### Using Docker

1. Ensure that you have Docker installed on your local machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local environment.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
