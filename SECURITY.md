# Git Security Policy

### Issue Title:
Please use an appropriate tag in the title to clearly indicate whether you are reporting a feature or a bug. Use [FEATURE] for new feature requests, [BUG] for bug reports and [VULNERABILITY] in the issue title to clearly indicate that you are reporting a security vulnerability. This will help us categorize and prioritize the issues appropriately.

### Description:
Provide a detailed description of the feature or bug you are reporting. Be as specific as possible and include any relevant information that might help us understand the issue or desired functionality. Explain the problem or expected behavior clearly and concisely.

### Environment:
Please include the environment details in your report, such as the operating system, browser, version, or any other relevant software or hardware configuration. This information will assist us in reproducing and troubleshooting the reported issue.

###Vulnerability Classification:
If you have knowledge about the type or classification of the vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, privilege escalation), please provide that information. It will help us better understand the nature of the issue and its potential impact.

### Steps to Reproduce (for bugs):
In the case of a bug report, it is crucial to provide a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue. This will help our developers to isolate and fix the problem effectively. If applicable, include a code snippet or a minimal code sample that demonstrates the bug.

### Expected Results:
Describe the expected outcome or desired functionality when reporting a bug or suggesting a feature. This will help us better understand your requirements and evaluate the proposed changes accurately.

### Additional Information (optional):
If you have any supplementary information, screenshots, error messages, or relevant context that you believe would be helpful, please include it in the report. This can assist us in resolving the issue more efficiently.
Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are.
